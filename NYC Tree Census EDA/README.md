# Exploring New York City's Tree Census Data

## Introduction

This portfolio project focuses on the exploration of the New York City Tree Census dataset to gain insights into the city's urban tree population. By utilizing SQL for data analysis and Tableau for visualization, the project aims to uncover interesting patterns, distribution, and health conditions of the trees across the city's boroughs.

## Project Overview

- **Data Source:** The project utilizes the New York City Tree Census dataset found in the google's bigquery public data market, collected in 2015, which includes detailed information on tree species, health, status, and location across the city's five boroughs.
- **Tools Used:** SQL was employed for data querying and analysis, while Tableau was utilized for data visualization and creating interactive maps.
- **Objectives:** The primary objectives of this project are to analyze the distribution of tree species, examine health conditions, explore borough-wise variations, and visualize the findings on interactive maps. The secondary objective is to find ideal locations for taking wonderful pictures, suitable trees for kids to play, harmful areas to avoid etc

## Key Findings

1. **Species Distribution:** Analysis of the dataset revealed the most common tree species in New York City, highlighting their prevalence and diversity across different boroughs.
2. **Health Conditions:** The health assessment of trees showcased the overall well-being of the urban forest, providing insights into the proportions of trees in good, fair, and poor health conditions.
3. **Borough-wise Variations:** By examining the data at the borough level, the project explores variations in tree populations, health conditions, and species diversity among different areas of the city.
4. **Interactive Maps:** Utilizing Tableau, the project created visually engaging and interactive maps, enabling users to explore the distribution of tree species, health conditions, and other relevant insights across various neighborhoods of New York City.

## Conclusion

Through this project, a deeper understanding of New York City's urban tree population, their distribution, and health conditions has been gained. The utilization of SQL for data analysis and Tableau for visualization allowed for effective exploration and presentation of the insights derived from the dataset. By showcasing this project in a portfolio, it aims to demonstrate skills in data analysis, visualization, and the ability to extract meaningful information from complex datasets.
